# Calamares
A mechanism to develop a GUI based installer for any kind of linux distros.    
I've recently faced with a project that aimed to develop a new distribution of linux. In order to develop the installation wizard, I've used [Calamares](https://calamares.io/)
which is an extraordinary tool to develop that kind of installers. In this repo, I'm trying to share whatever I've learned during this project.(It's absolutely not going to be the best document for learning the Calamares, but I'm almmost think It can resolve your problem If you are a beginner user)
